## About This Event
Join us on our second RAiD Learning day, a day where we bringing together members and friends of our RAiD community to connect, collaborate and learn about innovation and digital transformation!

### DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION WITH GENE KIM

In the first session, we are honoured to have Gene Kim, a multiple award-winning CTO, researcher and author from the United States who has been studying high-performing technology organizations since 1999. More notably, he is the author of six books, including Wall Street Journal best-selling books on digital transformation in large, complex organisations like the Unicorn Project, the Phoenix Project and the DevOps Handbook.

Come meet Gene Kim and learn more the Unicorn Project, a novel that elucidates the importance of DevOps in helping large organizations win and survive in today's ever-changing socioeconomic and political climate. He'll also talk more about the Five Ideals of DevOps he believes is crucial in creating better value sooner, safer and happier.

He will also share the work he has been doing with Dr. Steven Spear towards a theory of organizations, describing how organization structure and architecture may be one of the best leading indicators of performance. This title (yet to be named) is coming in 2023.

You'll also have a chance to win signed copies of the Unicorn Project during the book giveaway and Q&A sessions!

### THE FIVE IDEALS AT RAID: OUR PROCESS AND PROBLEMS

Did you know you could build apps on MINDEF/SAF's OSIT environment using tools like Microsoft Access and Sharepoint? What does a DevOps workflow look like, from the development of a feature to the deployment of the feature on a live environment?

Building on the sharing by Gene Kim and the Five Ideals of DevOps, the second session will see our own members of RAiD from the RSAF Data Office (RDO) and Software Engineering Squadron (SES) share more about their process and struggles of creating value across different user communities, platforms and technology stacks, and how they've achieved and are striving to achieve the Five Ideals.

### LET'S BREAK OUR SILOS!

More than just sharing about our own processes and problems, we also want to learn from our friends across the organization and begin breaking out of our organizational silos.

We're excited to have you join us in a Fireside Chat to share about your own process and problems when it comes to your own journey of creating value, as well as how the Five Ideals apply to your process.

In line with Gene Kim's emphasis on organization architecture, we want to invite you to join in a fun and interactive Organization Mapping session where we each, quite literally, try to place ourselves in the organization's innovation ecosystem with the help of a bunch of post-its, markers, and a good old whiteboard. We'll be transferring this same organizational map onto Miro, and sending out the link to everyone so we can look back and connect with the people we've met!
